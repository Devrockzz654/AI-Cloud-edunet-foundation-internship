# Hotel Booking Analysis

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to uncover important factors that govern the bookings. The analysis helps to explore questions such as the best time of year to book a hotel room, the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate, and predicting whether a hotel is likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests.

## Project Description

The project involves several steps:

1. **Loading the Data**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
3. **Analysis**:
    - Identify the best time of year to book a hotel room based on the average daily rate.
    - Determine the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate.
    - Predict the likelihood of receiving a high number of special requests using a logistic regression model.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devrockzz/hotel-booking-analysis.git
cd hotel-booking-analysis
```

2. **Place the Dataset**:
   
   Ensure the `hotel_bookings.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.

3. **Run the Script**:

```bash
python hotel_booking_analysis.py
```

4. **Output**:

   The script will display:
   - Basic information and summary statistics of the dataset.
   - Plots showing the average daily rate by month and length of stay.
   - Distribution of special requests.
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report of the logistic regression model predicting high special requests.
